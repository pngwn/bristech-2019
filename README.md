**Rerendering Perceptions with Svelte** - _Bristech 2019_

This is the source of the slides for a talk I gave at Bristech 2019. They are available onlie at [rerendering-perceptions.netlify.com](https://rerendering-perceptions.netlify.com/). You can [watch the talk video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUfsHKR6X9s).

They are designed only for desktop and are really designed to work woth Chrome's full-screen mode (ctrl+cmd+f on a mac) although this only matters for one or two slides.

You can move forward by pressing the right arrow key, you can't step backwards through the animations but you can navigate back in the borwser to go to a previous 'screen'.

There is a bunch of stuff that didn't end up being included for time reasons, some of which I was very sad about, a few of these things are lingering in this codebase still.
